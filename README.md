Wireshark Traffic Capture Report

1. Introduction

This report analyzes a 57-second Wireshark packet capture taken on the active network interface of a Windows system. 
The purpose of the capture was to observe network activity, identify common protocols, and analyze packet structure using Wireshark.

A total of 68 packets were recorded and examined.

2. Capture Information

File Type: Packet Dissection Export (from Wireshark)

Duration: ~57.216 seconds

Total Packets: 68

Environment: Local network (LAN)

Traffic Type: Primarily system multicast and service discovery traffic

3. Identified Protocols

At least three distinct network protocols were observed, fulfilling the project requirement. The major protocols captured include:

3.1 Multicast DNS (mDNS) – UDP 5353

Used for local network name resolution and service discovery (Bonjour/Avahi).
Examples include queries for macbook.local and associated IPv4/IPv6 responses.

3.2 IGMPv3 (Internet Group Management Protocol v3)

Manages IPv4 multicast group membership.
Observed packets include membership reports and leave messages directed to multicast groups.

3.3 ICMPv6 (Multicast Listener Reports)

Used to manage IPv6 multicast group listening.
Frequently seen in local link IPv6 networks.

3.4 UDP/XML (WS-Discovery / SOAP-over-UDP)

Multicast service discovery protocol used by Windows devices, printers, virtual adapters, etc.

3.5 IPv4 and IPv6

Standard Internet Protocol packets carrying higher-level payloads.

4.Observations

The capture primarily contained local network multicast discovery traffic, not external internet communication.

No DNS-to-internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8), TCP handshakes, HTTP, or TLS packets were present.

This means the capture was taken while the device was idle or not actively browsing.

All the observed traffic is normal background activity for local service discovery on a Windows or virtual network setup.

5. Conclusion

The Wireshark capture successfully recorded and identified multiple protocols, including mDNS, IGMP, ICMPv6, and WS-Discovery.
Analysis confirms the presence of multicast-based local discovery traffic commonly generated by operating systems and connected devices.

Although no web-browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) or external DNS packets were present, the capture meets the project requirements by 
identifying and analyzing more than three distinct network protocols.

If more diverse traffic is desired (e.g., DNS, TCP, HTTP), a new capture can be performed while browsing websites or pinging remote servers.
